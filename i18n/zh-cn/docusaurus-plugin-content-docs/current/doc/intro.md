# 教程介绍

让我们发现 **Docusaurus 不到 5 分钟**.

## 入门指南

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 14 or above:
  - 在安装Node.js时，建议你勾选所有与依赖性有关的复选框。

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

在你运行命令后，经典模板将自动添加到你的项目中:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/doc/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
